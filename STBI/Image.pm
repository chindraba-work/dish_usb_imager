# Things to do with images
#   Verify integrity of existing image file
#   Verify integrity of existing zip archive
#   Report contents of manifest file in the image
#   Create mountable partition image from image file
#   Check timestamp
#   Verify server access https://dns.dish.com
#       Should be stored in a config file somewhere
#   Retrieve remote version's number 
#       File name should look like STBImage_V11.zip, meaning version 11
#   Retrieve remote version's timestamp
#   Download zip file as original filename
#       File name something like STBImage_V17.zip
#       Generate and store the integity digest for the new zip file
#       Hardlink copy to filename stored in config file
#           current choice is: STBImage.zip
#       Don't forget to touch the file if needed.
#       Locate the name of the image file in the zip file
#           Something like Qvick_Soak3_px1205.img
#       Decompress downloaded file
#       Generate and store the new integrity digest for the image file
